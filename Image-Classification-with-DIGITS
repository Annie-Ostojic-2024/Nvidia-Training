# Trained a neural network using clean labeled data; built a tool that can predict labels of new images (Caffe with DIGITS)
# Image Classification with DIGITS: Nvidia Deep Learning Institute course (completed)
# code annotated below with parts that I self-coded 

# majority of the course was done in DIGITS with drop-down menus or file location coding lines
# a few coding lines in Python are shown below
# ReLU with Convolution and Pooling Layers coding is shown below (parts that I self-coded are annotated) 

# first coding line (all self-coded): used to classify multiple files if we put them in a list
from IPython.display import FileLink, FileLinks
FileLinks('images/test_images_list')

# second coding line: directory for augmented data - used in DIGITS (all self-coded)
/dli/data/image_class/train_invert

# third snippet of coding: convolution layers that I self-coded are listed below (connected a Rectilinear Unit/ReLU to the first pool)
